# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library.

## Overview

The Snake game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: Use arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- Increasing difficulty: As the snake grows longer, it becomes more challenging to avoid collisions.
- Randomized food placement: Food spawns at random positions on the screen after being eaten by the snake.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

2. Install the required dependencies:
3. 
Control the snake's movement using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Try to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake itself.
